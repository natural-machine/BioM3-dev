"""Named weight-set bundles.

A weight set clumps the Stage 1/2/3 trained checkpoints that belong together
into one JSON file (e.g. ``configs/weights/run1_base.json``) so a whole model
stack can be selected with a single ``--weight_set`` flag instead of three
separate path arguments.

Bundle paths follow the same convention as the rest of the repo's configs:
relative paths resolve against the working directory (run from the repo root),
absolute paths are used as-is. The bundle itself supports config composition
via ``load_json_config``.

A bundle can also record how its weights were trained, so a run can be checked
against it: ``pencl_trained_with_text_attention_mask`` and
``proteoscribe_trained_with_normalized_zc``, each true or false.
