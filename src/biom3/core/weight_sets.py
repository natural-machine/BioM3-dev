"""Named weight-set bundles.

A weight set clumps the Stage 1/2/3 trained checkpoints that belong together
into one JSON file (e.g. ``configs/weights/run1_base.json``) so a whole model
stack can be selected with a single ``--weight_set`` flag instead of three
separate path arguments.

Bundle paths follow the same convention as the rest of the repo's configs:
relative paths resolve against the working directory (run from the repo root),
absolute paths are used as-is. The bundle itself supports config composition
via ``load_json_config``.

A bundle can also record how its PenCL weights were trained, under
``pencl_trained_with_text_attention_mask`` (true or false), so a run can be
checked against it.
